 * factory methods which grant access to the various services contained within
 * the API.
 *
 * Configuration is simple. Pass in an array of configuration options to the
 * constructor up front which can be shared between clients or specify the
 * options for the specific services you wish to access, e.g. Datastore, or
 * Storage.
